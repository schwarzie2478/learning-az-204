###  Why we need containers and why we are using containers today

we put in [[Containers]] and those containers were different sizes uh which means we needed a lot of manpower 
Bbasically we revolutionized the way we ship things  by putting them in containers because if you put them in a container and a container has a very specific size 

we do the same in software development because you as a developer you create an application but the guy from operations that needs to install the software somewhere he doesn't really need to know about the software he just needs to know how to deploy it and how to deploy it if we work with containers can be standardized so you can deploy it in the cloud or on premise
