## Create codespaces in github
go to the Code button on top of your repo and choose the tab Codespaces.
There you can ask to setup an codespace for the repo


> [!NOTE]
> Don't forget to delete the codespace after you are done!

Go to https://github.com/codespaces and delete it!

Investigate:

- [ ] How is this connected to [[devcontainer]]
- [ ] Is [[requirements.txt]] part of this setup
