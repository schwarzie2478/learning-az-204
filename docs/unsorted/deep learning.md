Deep learning is a type of [[machine learning]] that uses [[neural networks]].

Using deep learning, the neural networks can make decisions based on [[unstructured data]] and/ or [[unlabeled data]]

neural networks consist of interconnected units that collaborate to learn from data and produce informed predictions to solve complex problems

> [!NOTE]
> neural networks are structured so that they can continue to learn and make predictions without directions
