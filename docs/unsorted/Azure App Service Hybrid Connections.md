[[Hybrid Connections]] is both a service in Azure and a feature in Azure App Service. As a service, it has uses and capabilities beyond those that are used in App Service.

Hybrid Connections requires a relay agent to be deployed where it can reach both the desired endpoint and Azure.

To learn more about Hybrid Connections and their usage outside App Service, seeÂ [[Azure Relay Hybrid Connections]].

There are many benefits to the Hybrid Connections capability, including:

- Apps can access on-premises systems and services securely.
- The feature doesn't require an internet-accessible endpoint.
- It's quick and easy to set up. No gateways required.
- Each Hybrid Connection matches to a single host:port combination, helpful for security.
- It normally doesn't require firewall holes. The connections are all outbound over standard web ports.
- Because the feature is network level, it's agnostic to the language used by your app and the technology used by the endpoint.
- It can be used to provide access in multiple networks from a single app.
- Supported in GA for Windows apps and Linux apps. It isn't supported for Windows custom containers.
