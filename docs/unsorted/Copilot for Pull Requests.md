This new functionality is powered by OpenAIâ€™s new GPT-4 model, and adds support for AI-powered tags in pull-request descriptions through a GitHub app that organization admins and individual repository owners can install. These tags are automatically filled out by GitHub Copilot based on the changed code. Developers can then review or modify the suggested description.
