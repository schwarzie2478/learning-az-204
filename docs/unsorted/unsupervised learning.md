1. **Unsupervised learning** In unsupervised learning, the data points exist without any attached labels or categories. Unlike supervised learning, which deals with data that is already labeled, unsupervised learning focuses on organizing data and uncovering hidden patterns.2
    
    The unsupervised learning method involves organizing data into distinct clusters or exploring different viewpoints to simplify complex data and enhance data analysis.3 The goal is to discover meaningful connections within the data rather than relying on predefined labels.
    
    While supervised learning assigns labels like “cat” and “dog” to images, unsupervised learning involves finding inherent patterns without the aid of explicit labels. Imagine a machine learning system is tasked with sorting through a collection of wildlife photographs that don’t include information on animal species. In this example, unsupervised learning algorithms can identify similar features in images and group them without being explicitly instructed about the specific animal.
