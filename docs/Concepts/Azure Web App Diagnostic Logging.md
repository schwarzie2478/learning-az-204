## Types of logging

| Type                   | Platform       | Location                                           | Description                                                                                                                                                 |
| ---------------------- | -------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Application logging    | Windows, Linux | App Service file system and/or Azure Storage blobs | Logs messages generated by your application code.                                                                                                           |
| Web server logging     | Windows        | App Service file system or Azure Storage blobs     | Raw HTTP request data in the W3C extended log file format.                                                                                                  |
| Detailed error logging | Windows        | App Service file system                            | Copies of the _.html_ error pages that would have been sent to the client browser.                                                                          |
| Failed request tracing | Windows        | App Service file system                            | Detailed tracing information on failed requests, including a trace of the IIS components used to process the request and the time taken in each component.  |
| Deployment logging     | Windows, Linux | App Service file system                            | Helps determine why a deployment failed. Deployment logging happens automatically and there are no configurable settings for deployment logging.            |

## Logging in Code

```csharp
System.Diagnostics.Trace.TraceError("something bad happened");
```


> [!hint] Python
> Python applications can use the [OpenCensus package](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/opencensus-python) to send logs to the application diagnostics log

## Log streaming

Follow along from [[Azure Cloud Shell]] or with [[Azure CLI]]:
```shell
az webapp log tail --name appname --resource-group myResourceGroup
```

## Access log files

If you configure the Azure Storage blobs option for a log type, you need a client tool that works with Azure Storage.

For logs stored in the App Service file system, the easiest way is to download the ZIP file in the browser at:

- Windows apps: `https://<app-name>.scm.azurewebsites.net/api/dump`
