1. **Supervised learning** In supervised learning, the algorithm uses existing information or data points that come with clear labels or categories.2 For example, the algorithm is trained on a number of cat and dog pictures (of various types) to differentiate between the two animals based on features like color, size, ears, nose, etc. Once it is trained, it can then label any new images given to it as “cat” or “dog”.
    
    This enables the machine to identify dogs and cats of various colors, sizes, and features.
    
    The objective of supervised learning is for the machine to learn from many labeled examples.
