### Responsibilities of a master data management system

The responsibilities of such a system include:

- **Modeling data objects** – especially for the main data assets.
- **Maintaining data hierarchies** or relationships between data objects.
- **Connecting to all data sources** or applications.
- **Tracking changes** made to any connected database.
- **Processing changes** made to connected databases and intelligently synchronizing updates.
- This may include **validating**, **formatting**, **[standardizing](https://dataladder.com/data-standardization-software/)**, or **[matching](https://dataladder.com/data-matching-software/)** the new data before it is replicated in other nodes.
- **Enabling governance rules** for automated alerts, moderation workflows, data sharing capabilities, etc.
