An App Service Environment is an [[Azure App Service]] feature that provides a fully isolated and dedicated environment for running App Service apps securely at high scale.


- It's for a single-tenant, you get your own hardware
- a specific [[Azure App Service]] deployment
- Â you don't need to use [[virtual network integration]] because the ASE is already in your [[Azure Virtual Network]]

To access Azure storage or other services: enable [[service endpoints]] on the ASE subnet.
