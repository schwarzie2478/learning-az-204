gRPCÂ is a language agnostic, high-performance [[Remote Procedure Call]]  framework.

The main benefits of gRPC are:

- Modern, high-performance, lightweight RPC framework.
- [[Contract-first API development]], using Protocol Buffers by default, allowing for language agnostic implementations.
- Tooling available for many languages to generate strongly-typed servers and clients.
- Supports client, server, and bi-directional streaming calls.
- Reduced network usage with [[Protobuf]] binary serialization.
