1. **Reinforcement learning** In reinforcement learning, the algorithm determines the best course of action based on data and feedback.2 For example, a robot uses its sensors to process information at certain time intervals. Once the algorithm categorizes and labels the collected information, an immediate feedback signal evaluates the algorithm’s effectiveness.
    
    This iterative process enables the algorithm to refine the labeling process over time. The algorithm processes input data to create outputs, followed by an immediate feedback signal that gauges the effectiveness of the output. Based on this signal, the algorithm adjusts itself in order to achieve the highest reward.
