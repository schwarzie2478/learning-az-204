Part of [[cryptography]]

In a **public-key encryption** system, anyone with a [[public key]] can [encrypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption "Encryption") a message, yielding a **[[ciphertext]]**, but only those who know the corresponding [[private key]] can decrypt the ciphertext to obtain the original message.
