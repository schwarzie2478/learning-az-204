The purpose of a columnar [database](https://www.techtarget.com/searchdatamanagement/definition/database) is to efficiently read data from [hard disk](https://www.techtarget.com/searchstorage/definition/hard-disk-drive) storage in order to speed up the time it takes to return a [query](https://www.techtarget.com/searchdatamanagement/definition/query). Columnar databases store data in a way that greatly improves disk [I/O](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/input-output-I-O) performance. They are particularly helpful for [data analytics](https://www.techtarget.com/searchdatamanagement/definition/data-analytics) and [data warehousing](https://www.techtarget.com/searchdatamanagement/definition/data-warehouse).

Row-oriented databases store the data for each row together, while columnar databases store the data for each column together.
