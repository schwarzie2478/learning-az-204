Fast Feedback Loops

Qualifications give immediate insight into the viability of your configuration, and let you encode policy directly into the simulation.

Focused collaboration

Fully multiplayer visual interface provides easy collaboration between experts - the heart of DevOps work.

Delightful customization

Add new functionality, enforce policy - everything is a TypeScript function sitting on a reactive hypergraph.
