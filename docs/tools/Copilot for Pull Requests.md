This new functionality is powered by [[OpenAI]]â€™s new [[GPT-4]] model, and adds support for AI-powered tags in [[pull-request]] descriptions through a GitHub app that organization admins and individual repository owners can install. These tags are automatically filled out by GitHub [[Copilot]] based on the changed code. Developers can then review or modify the suggested description.
